# Testing with Jasmine

This project was completed as a requirement for my Front-End Web Development Nanodegree from Udacity. I was given the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the application to function correctly. My job was to write tests using Jasmine that ensure future updates will not break current functionality.

## Getting started

In order to run the application, clone the git project, then open index.html in your browser.
